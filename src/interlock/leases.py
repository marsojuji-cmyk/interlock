"""Time-bounded authority grants with keepalive renewal.

A lease is the only form authority takes in Interlock: a named holder, a
named resource, and a time-to-live. The grant is the single moment authority
comes into existence; without keepalive renewal the lease expires, and an
unexercised grant simply decays. The clock is injectable so tests can drive
time deterministically.

The manager keeps its own record of every lease it issued. That record, not
the caller's ``Lease`` object, is the source of truth for expiry and
revocation: a hand-built ``Lease``, a lease from another manager, or a lease
whose fields were edited after issue is not recognised as issued.
