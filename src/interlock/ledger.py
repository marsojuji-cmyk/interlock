"""A self-describing JSONL run log.

The ledger opens with a format descriptor, each series declares its schema
on first use, every record carries its series and capture time, and the log
closes with a random-access index. A reader with no prior knowledge can
still audit the run. Accepts a path string, a file-like object, or nothing
— the default is an in-memory buffer.

A path opens in append mode by default: reopening an existing ledger keeps
every earlier run and starts a new self-describing segment (format
descriptor, series descriptors, records, closing index). Pass ``mode="w"``
to truncate deliberately.

Every line is flushed as it is written, so a record survives the writing
process crashing. ``close()`` also fsyncs a file the ledger opened itself.
